<h1>Seiyuu Birthday Countdown</h1>

<p>A simple script that will show you your selected seiyuu whose birthdays are approaching.</p>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<p>In order to use this script, create a text file called seiyuu_list.txt and populate it with names of seiyuu you are interested in and whose birthdays you want to be reminded of. Use the Japanese order of names and write every new name on a new line. If you are not sure about the correct order, consult Google or Wikipedia.
There already is a sample text file with a few entries in the repository, so it is enough to edit it accordingly and fill it with your selection of names.</p>

<p><b>Run</b> the script by executing seiyuubirthdaycountdown.py.</p>

<p>The seiyuu you want to have in your list must be included in the database. In case you are missing someone, you can add them by editing the seiyuu_database.csv file. Insert each entry on a new line and separate the fields by comma.</p>
